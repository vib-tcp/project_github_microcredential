This repository is made as an assignment for the UGent/VIB course "Reproducible Data Analysis".
The repository must contain the following files

- [`cheat-sheet.md`](./doc/cheat-sheet.md) a file with useful git commands
- [`best-practices.md`](./doc/best-practices.md) a file with some best practices using Git and GitHub
- [`concepts-git-github.md`](./doc/best-practices.md) a file important concepts of Git and GitHub explained
- [`examples.md`](./doc/examples.m) a file in which some examples are illustrated


The folder structure was inspired by [this webpage](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/organizing-projects/) and 
[this webpage](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405).
