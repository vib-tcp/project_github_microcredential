# Micro-credentials Project

Hi! We are Adrien and Arthur and this our amazing GitHub project, where we show we've totally mastered all the cool Git and Github stuff we recently learned about.

In particular,
- we **forked this repo** and **collaborate on the same forked repo**
- we created a **cheat-sheet markdown file with examples**
- our repo contains a **folder**, a **README file**, a **gitignore file**, and a **license**
- we worked with **3 different branches**
- we created **10 commits each** at least
- one of our commits is actually a **revert**
- the cheat_sheet file contains a number of **new GitHub commands** that were not discussed in the course
- each of us has [OOPS an error] resolved several massive **conflicts**
- we have at least **one tag** in the project
- we communicated via **GitHub issues**
- we've mainly used the **CL**

We might have been a tiny bit more ambitious by adding
- https://medium.com/@tcij1013/best-practices-for-organizing-git-repositories-61e4538c3900
- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/86914/whats-the-best-structure-for-a-repository? 

We definitely need to
- **merge all branches** for the final version
- make a PR to the original repo
