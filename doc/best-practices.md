
- Always save the files before commiting 
- When commiting, always include a meaningful message. This should be clarify how was the issue addressed i.e. specify the changes/updates, why was it changed, effects due to change, limitations of the change (if not entirely final version)
- Keep the timeline as clear as possible 
- include a README file with general description about the project and instructions
- Always make sure that there is only one .git repo in your folder. 
- when collaborating, make sure that you always synchronize first with `git pull` and `git push` once you have made the required changes
- when you give the branch a name, it is interesting to add your initials so it is clear that you are working on it
- Always close all the  files when moving between branches
