**When to use git and Github: illustrated with examples**


## Collaboration ##
For example:
* Conflict resolving individually 
* Experimenting risk free in different branches 
* Developing a pipeline together 

How:
By adding collaborators to a repo on Github. They can either clone the repo locally or fork the repo. 
1. When cloning locally, changes can be added, commited, and pushed to Github. Other collaborators can pull the changes. 
Furthermore, they can work in separate branches, to work individually and merge all work together in the end. 
2. When a repo is forked, changes can be made but will only be edited in the original repo once a pull request is accepted 


## Version Control for personal projects ##

In project, software is often updated. However, a pipeline needs to be adapted accordingly to the version changes and you want to keep the previously working pipeline. Git is useful to track all of these versions.  


## Tracking changes in a paper ##

When making a paper, you can track all edits/changes using git and github. All versions should be added, commited, and pushed, but a clear timeline should be maintained. Yet, to make advantage of git, the paper/manuscript should be written as text. For instance,
using latex. Document types like .docx that are not readable as text files are not ideal.

## Use of pipelines ## 
On GitHub, a wide variety of pipelines are available that can be used for your own research/work. These pipeline can be cloned locally. Alternatively, you can fork them, and make your own changes. Through a pull request, suggestions of changes can be made to the original owner of the pipeline.
