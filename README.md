# Micro-credentials Project

If you found this repository and is not registered in [our micro-credential](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/micro-credential-reproducible-data-analysis-an-essential-capability-in-modern-science-en) please read more in the last topic.

You should **fork this repository** and in collaboration with a colleague that is also part of the micro-credential course. You develop the project together.
The project is simple, and consists of creating a repository for documenting concepts, best practices, examples and a cheat-sheet on using Git & GitHub.

Your repository must contain a **folder structure, a README file, a gitignore file, a license**. All files must be developed in markdown (MD), you can find more information about [MD here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and about [Liascript](https://liascript.github.io/), a MD dialect. You can add images and printscreens if you want.

<span style="color:mediumBlue"> **Think about and inform yourself via internet resources about a useful folder structure in the repository, and cite your sources (2,3, as you see fit)**.</span>


Define the your collaboration strategy considering:
----------------------------------------------------

1. Both should work in different branches

    a. A minimum of 3 branches must be available (main, partner1 and partner2), if necessary more branches can be created.
    
    b. The delivered project should be the final merged version.

    c. You can merge directly or using branch pull request if you want someone to review.

2. A minimum of 10 commits per person must be seen in the history.

3. You need to have at least two solved conflicts in the history, one by each person.

4. You need to revert at least on commit.

5. Include examples in your documents, you can decide where and how this fits better.

6. Search for other Git commands, that were not introduced in the course, choose one or more that you agree could be useful in your work and include in the documentation.

7. You must have at least one tag in your project.

8. Review and communicate with each other using GitHub-issues.

9. Work as much as possible using command line.

Delivery
-----------

Once with the final version you must <span style="color:mediumBlue">make a pull request</span> to this repository.


**Micro-credential |** Reproducible Data Analysis: an Essential Capability in Modern Science
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is part the first evaluation of the micro-credetial that is offered by [VIB](https://vib.be/en#/) and [UGent](https://www.ugent.be/en) with the aim to improve data analysis reproducbility in science. A micro-credential is like a mini-diploma that you have followed a course and learnd a new skill that is valuable for your carrear. If you are interested to register you can find more detais in the [UGent registration page](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/micro-credential-reproducible-data-analysis-an-essential-capability-in-modern-science-en).


collaboration strategy: 
1. every collaborator creates a separate branch (leena, rafael, sara, main)
2. Leena works on git concepts, Rafael on github concepts, Sara on Markdown concepts
3. We communicate via Teams to update each other on the process and conflict creation/resolving.
4. second meeting on Thursday 27th at 2PM
